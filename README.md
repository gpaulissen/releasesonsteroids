# releasesonsteroids
Based on download from "Maven Releases on Steroids (3): Rounding it up with Jenkins" by Axel Fontaine.

Changed the project so it complies with Maven 3.6.1.

Used ${revision} instead of ${VERSION_NUMBER} since that complies with Allow continuous delivery friendly versions, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-5576.
